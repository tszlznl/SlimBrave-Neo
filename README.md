SlimBrave Neo uses Chromium enterprise managed policies to disable telemetry, bloat, and unwanted features in Brave Browser. No browser extensions, no hacks, just clean policy enforcement that Brave respects natively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The only official source of SlimBrave Neo is this repository:**
> [`github.com/ChaoticSi1ence/SlimBrave-Neo`](https://github.com/ChaoticSi1ence/SlimBrave-Neo)
>
> This project ships **source code only**. Python and PowerShell scripts you can read before running.
> **There are no official `.exe`, `.msi`, `.dmg`, `.pkg`, installers, or compiled binaries.**
> If you find a download claiming to be SlimBrave-Neo elsewhere, it is not from this project. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Linux users: consider [Brave Origin](https://brave.com/origin/linux/nightly/) first.**
> Brave Origin is a free, official Brave variant that ships with telemetry and bloat already removed. If you just want a clean Brave without configuration, that's the simpler path.
>
> The Linux version of SlimBrave Neo is still fully supported, and is the right tool if you want fine-grained control over individual policies, custom presets, or your own DoH templates beyond what Origin provides out of the box.

## Quick Start

### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaoticSi1ence/SlimBrave-Neo.git
cd SlimBrave-Neo
sudo python3 slimbrave-linux.py
```

That's it. No `pip install`, no `jq`, no external dependencies. Just Python 3 and root.

**CLI mode (non-interactive):**

```bash
sudo python3 slimbrave-linux.py --import "./Presets/Maximum Privacy Preset.json"
sudo python3 slimbrave-linux.py --export ~/SlimBraveNeoSettings.json
sudo python3 slimbrave-linux.py --reset
```

**Multiple Brave channels (Stable / Beta / Nightly):** Brave hardcodes the managed-policy directory to `/etc/brave/policies` for every channel, so a single policy file applies to all of them — no per-channel selector is needed. If multiple channels are installed, leaked Shields exceptions are scrubbed from each channel's user-data directory and "Brave is running" detection covers all installed channels.

After applying, restart Brave and verify at `brave://policy`.

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaoticSi1ence/SlimBrave-Neo.git
cd SlimBrave-Neo
sudo python3 slimbrave-mac.py
```

Policies are written to `/Library/Managed Preferences/com.brave.Browser.plist`. Requires root.

**Multiple Brave channels (Stable / Beta / Nightly):** each channel uses its own bundle ID and managed plist on macOS. When more than one channel is detected, the TUI shows a "Brave Channels" section at the top — channel rows are unchecked by default, and any channel that already has a SlimBrave-managed plist is pre-checked so a re-run shows you which channels are currently managed without writing to channels you didn't ask about. Pick the channels you want to apply to before clicking Apply.

**CLI mode (non-interactive):**

```bash
sudo python3 slimbrave-mac.py --import "./Presets/Maximum Privacy Preset.json"
sudo python3 slimbrave-mac.py --export ~/SlimBraveNeoSettings.json
sudo python3 slimbrave-mac.py --reset

# Restrict CLI actions to specific channels (default: all detected)
sudo python3 slimbrave-mac.py --import preset.json --channels stable,beta
```

After applying, restart Brave and verify at `brave://policy`.

### Windows

```powershell
iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaoticSi1ence/SlimBrave-Neo/main/SlimBrave.ps1" -OutFile "SlimBrave.ps1"; .\SlimBrave.ps1
```

Requires Administrator privileges.

## CLI Reference

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--import PATH` | Import a SlimBrave Neo JSON config and apply policies |
| `--export PATH` | Export current policy to a SlimBrave Neo JSON config |
| `--reset` | Remove the managed policy file |
| `--policy-file PATH` | Override policy file path |
| `--doh-templates URL` | Set custom DNS-over-HTTPS template URL |
| `--channels LIST` | Comma-separated channels to target (`stable,beta,nightly`). Default `auto` = all detected. macOS writes one plist per channel; Linux always shares a single policy file. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

Import/export uses the same JSON format as the Windows PowerShell version. Configs are cross-platform compatible.

<details>
<summary><strong>Presets</strong></summary>

### Maximum Privacy Preset
- **Telemetry:** Blocks all reporting (metrics, safe browsing, URL collection, feedback).
- **Privacy:** Disables autofill, password manager, sign-in, WebRTC leaks, QUIC, and forces Do Not Track.
- **Brave Features:** Kills Rewards, Wallet, VPN, AI Chat, Tor, and Sync.
- **Performance:** Disables background processes, recommendations, and bloat.
- **DNS:** Uses plain DNS (no HTTPS) to prevent potential logging by DoH providers.
- **Best for:** Paranoid users, journalists, activists, or anyone who wants Brave as private as possible.

### Balanced Privacy Preset
- **Telemetry:** Blocks all tracking but keeps basic safe browsing.
- **Privacy:** Blocks third-party cookies, enables Do Not Track, but allows password manager and autofill for addresses.
- **Brave Features:** Disables Rewards, Wallet, VPN, and AI features.
- **Performance:** Turns off background services and ads.
- **DNS:** Uses automatic DoH (lets Brave choose the fastest secure DNS).
- **Best for:** Most users who want privacy but still need convenience features.

### Performance Focused Preset
- **Telemetry:** Only blocks metrics and feedback surveys (keeps some safe browsing).
- **Brave Features:** Disables Rewards, Wallet, VPN, and AI to declutter the browser.
- **Performance:** Kills background processes, shopping features, and promotions.
- **DNS:** Automatic DoH for a balance of speed and security.
- **Best for:** Users who want a faster, cleaner Brave without extreme privacy tweaks.

### Developer Preset
- **Telemetry:** Blocks all reporting.
- **Brave Features:** Disables Rewards, Wallet, and VPN but keeps developer tools.
- **Performance:** Turns off background services and ads.
- **DNS:** Automatic DoH (default secure DNS).
- **Best for:** Developers who need dev tools but still want telemetry and ads disabled.

### Strict Parental Controls Preset
- **Privacy:** Blocks incognito mode, forces Google SafeSearch, and disables sign-in.
- **Brave Features:** Disables Rewards, Wallet, VPN, Tor, and dev tools.
- **DNS:** Uses custom DoH (can be set to a family-friendly DNS like Cloudflare for Families).
- **Best for:** Parents, schools, or workplaces that need restricted browsing.

## How It Works

SlimBrave Neo writes Chromium [managed enterprise policies](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/) to platform-specific locations. Brave reads these on startup and enforces the policies. No browser modifications needed.

| Platform | Policy Location |
|----------|----------------|
| Linux | `/etc/brave/policies/managed/slimbrave.json` (shared across all channels) |
| macOS | `/Library/Managed Preferences/com.brave.Browser{,.beta,.nightly,.dev}.plist` (one per detected channel) |
| Windows | Registry keys via PowerShell |

**Additional behavior:**
- Auto-detects Brave installations: Arch (`brave-bin`), deb/rpm, Flatpak, Snap, macOS App (Stable / Beta / Nightly), and PATH fallback
- Reads existing policies on startup and pre-checks matching features; on macOS pre-checks any channel with an existing managed plist
- Full overwrite on Apply, so unchecked features are cleanly removed
- Import/export compatible with Windows PowerShell version (handles UTF-16 BOM encoding)
